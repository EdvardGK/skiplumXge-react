   - 54 academic and regulatory sources
   - Detailed methodology explanations
   - Cross-referenced with official standards

### Medium Reliability Sources (5-7/10)
2. **Technical-requirements_TEK17_claude.md** - Good compilation but needs primary verification
   - Comprehensive technical content
   - References official sources
   - AI-generated summary requires verification

3. **Comprehensive-market-analysis_claude.md** - Market claims need verification
   - Contains specific data points
   - Limited source attribution
   - Company examples need confirmation

### Design/Specification Sources (No reliability score needed)
4. **Energy Performance Dashboard_deepseek.txt** - Design guidelines
5. **Energy Insights Dashboard Design_grok.txt** - Product requirements

## Missing Primary Sources

### Critical Regulatory Sources Needed
1. **Official TEK17 Text** - Direct from DIBK (Direktoratet for byggkvalitet)
2. **NS 3031:2014 Standard** - Original Norwegian standard document
3. **EPBD Regulation Text** - EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive
4. **Current Building Code Updates** - Latest amendments and interpretations

### Company/Market Data Sources Needed
1. **Vasakronan Sustainability Reports** - To verify energy reduction claims
2. **PropTech Market Research** - Primary market size data sources
3. **React Three Fiber Documentation** - Official performance benchmarks
4. **Norwegian Building Statistics** - Official construction and energy data

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Verify TEK17 Claims** - Cross-check all regulatory requirements with official DIBK sources
2. **Confirm Market Data** - Find primary sources for market size and case study claims
3. **Check Technical Specifications** - Verify NS 3031:2014 formulas with original standard
4. **Validate Company Examples** - Confirm Vasakronan and other case study data

### Source Reliability Protocol
1. **Primary Sources**: Government regulations, official standards, company reports
2. **Secondary Sources**: Academic papers, professional analyses with citations
3. **Tertiary Sources**: AI-generated summaries, blog posts, unsourced claims
4. **Design Sources**: Creative specifications that don't require factual verification

### Quality Control Process
1. **Before Implementation**: Verify all technical claims with primary sources
2. **During Development**: Test calculations against official standards
3. **Before Launch**: Validate market claims and case studies
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor for regulation updates and standard changes

## Source Verification Status Legend
- üü¢ **VERIFIED**: Confirmed against primary/authoritative sources
- üü° **NEEDS VERIFICATION**: Good secondary source, requires primary confirmation
- ‚ùå **UNVERIFIED**: Claims made without sufficient source backing
- ‚úÖ **NOT APPLICABLE**: Design specs or opinions that don't require factual verification

## Notes
- AI-generated documents are useful for compilation but always require primary source verification for factual claims
- Design and product specification documents don't need factual verification but should be user-tested
- Market data and case studies require the highest verification standards before use in business decisions
- Technical calculations must be verified against official standards before implementation
