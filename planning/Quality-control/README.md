# Quality Control System - Waterfall Dashboard Project

**Purpose**: Systematic verification of all claims, data points, and calculations used in project decisions
**Established**: January 25, 2025
**Status**: Active quality control framework

## üìã Quality Control Documents

### Core Documents
1. **`verified_facts.md`** - Facts confirmed from authoritative sources
2. **`unverified_claims.md`** - Assumptions requiring verification before implementation
3. **`calculation_verification.md`** - Mathematical formulas with test cases
4. **`source_audit.md`** - Assessment of research document reliability

## üéØ Quality Control Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Prevent false assumptions** from becoming implemented features
- **Verify calculations** before they affect user compliance checking
- **Track source reliability** to prioritize which claims to trust
- **Document verification methods** for future validation

### Success Criteria
- All high-risk assumptions tested before major development investment
- All mathematical formulas verified against official standards
- All market claims traceable to authoritative sources
- Clear separation between verified facts and working hypotheses

## üìä Current Status Summary

### Verified Facts (Ready for Implementation)
- ‚úÖ **TEK17 Energy Frame Formulas** - Official regulatory formulas documented
- ‚úÖ **React Three Fiber Performance** - Framework capabilities confirmed
- ‚úÖ **Northern Lights Color System** - Design specifications documented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Market Data** - Claims made but need primary source verification

### High-Risk Assumptions (Requiring Verification)
- üîç **Visual Engagement ‚Üí Behavior Change** - Core value proposition needs testing
- üîç **3D Visualization Value** - Major development investment needs validation
- üîç **Norwegian Market Readiness** - Business model viability assumption
- üîç **Aurora Theming Appeal** - Cultural resonance needs user testing

### Mathematical Accuracy
- ‚úÖ **Basic TEK17 Calculations** - Test cases developed, ready for implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NS 3031:2014 Methodology** - Complex calculations need full development
- ‚ùå **Monthly Energy Balance** - Framework defined, implementation required

### Source Reliability
- **High Quality (8-10/10)**: Energy Performance Estimation Tool (54 citations)
- **Medium Quality (5-7/10)**: Technical requirements compilation, market analysis
- **Design Specs**: Visual guidelines (don't require factual verification)

## üîÑ Quality Control Process

### Before Feature Development
1. **Check `unverified_claims.md`** - Is this feature based on unproven assumptions?
2. **Verify calculations** in `calculation_verification.md` - Are the formulas correct?
3. **Confirm source reliability** in `source_audit.md` - Can this data be trusted?
4. **Update verification status** when assumptions are tested

### During Implementation
1. **Test calculations** using provided test cases
2. **Implement verification methods** for untested assumptions
3. **Document new assumptions** that arise during development
4. **Update quality control documents** with new findings

### Before Release
1. **Final verification check** - All high-risk assumptions addressed?
2. **Calculation accuracy test** - Do the formulas produce correct results?
3. **Source validation** - Primary sources confirmed for all critical claims?
4. **User testing** - Key assumptions validated with target users?

## üìà Verification Priority Matrix

### üî¥ Critical (Must verify before development)
1. **TEK17 calculation accuracy** - Regulatory compliance at stake
2. **Market demand assumptions** - Business viability depends on this
3. **Technical feasibility** - 3D performance on target devices

### üü° Important (Verify during development)
1. **User experience assumptions** - Affects product success but not compliance
2. **Design preferences** - Can be A/B tested with real users
3. **Cultural resonance** - Important for adoption but not functionality

### üü¢ Nice to Have (Can proceed with reasonable confidence)
1. **Framework choices** - Well-documented alternatives available
2. **Visual design details** - Can be iterated based on user feedback
3. **Performance optimizations** - Can be addressed if problems arise

## üéØ Weekly Quality Control Checklist

### Every Week During Active Development
- [ ] Review `unverified_claims.md` - Any new assumptions need testing?
- [ ] Update `verified_facts.md` - Any claims verified or disproven?
- [ ] Check `calculation_verification.md` - Any formulas need updating?
- [ ] Audit new sources - Any new research documents to evaluate?
- [ ] Test high-risk assumptions - Any verification methods ready to execute?

### Monthly Reviews
- [ ] Overall source quality assessment
- [ ] Verification priority re-ranking
- [ ] New assumption identification
- [ ] Process improvement opportunities

## üö® Red Flags That Require Immediate Verification

### Implementation Red Flags
- Building features based on unverified market assumptions
- Using calculations without test case validation
- Making design decisions based on unsourced claims
- Proceeding with high-risk assumptions untested

### Source Red Flags
- AI-generated content without source verification
- Market data without primary source attribution
- Technical claims without official standard backing
- Case studies without company confirmation

## üí° Quality Control Tools and Methods

### Verification Methods Available
1. **A/B Testing** - For user experience assumptions
2. **User Interviews** - For market need validation
3. **Calculation Testing** - For mathematical accuracy
4. **Source Cross-Referencing** - For fact verification
5. **Performance Benchmarking** - For technical claims

### Documentation Standards
- **Every claim** must be traceable to a source
- **Every assumption** must have a verification method
- **Every calculation** must have test cases
- **Every source** must have reliability assessment

## üìû Quality Control Contacts

### Internal Verification
- **Technical Claims**: Cross-check with official Norwegian standards
- **Market Claims**: Verify with original company reports
- **Design Decisions**: Test with Norwegian property owner interviews

### External Verification Resources
- **DIBK (Direktoratet for byggkvalitet)**: Official TEK17 regulations
- **Standard Norge**: NS 3031:2014 and other building standards
- **Company Reports**: Vasakronan, other case study subjects
- **Academic Sources**: Research papers with peer review

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Quality Control Effectiveness
- **Zero critical bugs** from unverified calculations
- **High user adoption** from validated assumptions
- **Regulatory compliance** from verified standards
- **Sustainable development** from source-backed decisions

### Process Health Indicators
- Weekly quality control reviews completed: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- High-risk assumptions tested before implementation: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- New claims properly documented and sourced: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Verification methods executed on schedule: ‚úÖ/‚ùå

This quality control system ensures that the waterfall dashboard is built on a foundation of verified facts rather than unproven assumptions, reducing project risk and increasing the likelihood of successful market adoption.
