**Status**: üîç PENDING VERIFICATION
**Testing Timeline**: Phase 3 - after basic 3D is working

### TECH-003: React Three Fiber Optimal for This Use Case
**Hypothesis**: R3F provides best balance of performance, maintainability, React integration
**Source of Assumption**: Research documents recommend R3F for building applications
**Evidence Gap**: No direct comparison with alternatives for our specific requirements
**Verification Method**:
- Performance benchmarking against alternative solutions
- Developer productivity assessment
**Risk Level**: LOW - Well-documented framework choice
**Impact if False**: Framework migration possible but costly
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE RISK - Proceeding with implementation

## Market Assumptions

### MKT-001: Norwegian Market Ready for Premium Energy Tools
**Hypothesis**: Norwegian property owners will pay for sophisticated energy analysis beyond basic compliance
**Source of Assumption**: TEK17 requirements + PropTech market growth
**Evidence Gap**: No market research on willingness to pay for premium energy tools
**Verification Method**:
- Customer interviews about pain points and budget
- Pricing sensitivity analysis
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Business model viability
**Impact if False**: May need to focus on basic compliance only
**Status**: üîç PENDING VERIFICATION
**Testing Timeline**: Market research phase

### MKT-002: Dual Dashboard Strategy Reduces Risk
**Hypothesis**: Keeping grid dashboard while adding waterfall reduces implementation risk
**Source of Assumption**: Our strategic analysis
**Evidence Gap**: No precedent for this specific approach
**Verification Method**:
- Development complexity assessment
- User adoption patterns of each interface
**Risk Level**: LOW - Conservative approach
**Impact if False**: May focus on single interface
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE APPROACH - Proceeding

## Business Logic Assumptions

### BIZ-001: TEK17 Compliance Primary User Need
**Hypothesis**: Norwegian building owners primarily care about regulatory compliance
**Source of Assumption**: Research documents emphasize TEK17 requirements
**Evidence Gap**: May also want cost optimization, sustainability goals, etc.
**Verification Method**:
- User interviews about primary motivations
- Feature prioritization surveys
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Product positioning
**Impact if False**: May need to broaden value proposition
**Status**: üîç PENDING VERIFICATION
**Testing Timeline**: User research phase

### BIZ-002: Energy Visualization Leads to Action
**Hypothesis**: Showing energy problems visually motivates users to make improvements
**Source of Assumption**: General UX principles about visualization effectiveness
**Evidence Gap**: Energy domain may be different due to high costs, long payback periods
**Verification Method**:
- Track user actions after viewing dashboard
- Survey about intended actions vs. actual follow-through
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Core value proposition
**Impact if False**: May need to focus on compliance reporting only
**Status**: üîç PENDING VERIFICATION
**Testing Timeline**: Post-launch tracking

## Mathematical/Calculation Assumptions

### CALC-001: NS 3031:2014 Calculations Sufficient for User Needs
**Hypothesis**: Standard building energy calculations meet user accuracy requirements
**Source of Assumption**: Regulatory compliance focus
**Evidence Gap**: Users may need more detailed analysis for renovation planning
**Verification Method**:

- All HIGH priority assumptions should be tested before significant development investment
- MEDIUM priority can be tested during iterative development
- LOW priority assumptions are acceptable to build on, with monitoring
- Each assumption should have specific, measurable verification criteria
