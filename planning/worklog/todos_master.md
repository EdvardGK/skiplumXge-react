- Priority: Municipality statistics and local building performance context
- Expected Outcome: "X certified buildings in your kommune" messaging
- Competitive Differentiation: Insights no other platform can provide

### Week 2: Core Data Integration (Functional Excellence)
**Foundation**: Connect real Norwegian energy calculations
- Priority: SINTEF heat loss models and TEK17 compliance calculations
- Expected Outcome: Accurate energy analysis matching professional assessments
- User Value: Trustworthy recommendations and ROI calculations

### Week 3: 3D Visualization Enhancement (Engagement Factor)
**Immersion**: Advanced building rendering and neighborhood visualization
- Priority: Kartverket building footprints and Norwegian roof geometry
- Expected Outcome: Accurate 3D representations of actual buildings
- User Experience: Emotional connection through visual recognition

## Key Decisions Made

### Dual Dashboard Strategy ✅
**Decision**: Maintain both grid and waterfall dashboards with toggle functionality
**Rationale**: Serve different user preferences - analytical vs. emotional engagement
**Implementation**: Toggle component allows seamless switching with URL parameters preserved

### Enova Data as Competitive Moat ✅
**Decision**: Prioritize Enova database integration for unique market positioning
**Rationale**: Access to municipal certification data provides insights competitors cannot match
**Strategy**: "X certified buildings in your kommune" becomes signature differentiator

### Norwegian Energy Focus ✅
**Decision**: Deep integration with Norwegian energy standards and data sources
**Rationale**: Market specialization provides authority and accuracy
**Sources**: TEK17, SINTEF, Kartverket, SSB, Enova - comprehensive Norwegian ecosystem

### Aurora Visual Identity ✅
**Decision**: Northern lights metaphor for energy efficiency visualization
**Rationale**: Culturally relevant, emotionally engaging, visually distinctive
**Implementation**: Gradient backgrounds, particle effects, progressive color intensity

## Current Status Summary

**🎉 Major Milestone Achieved**: Frost API + Caching System + Certified Building Intelligence Implemented
**⚠️ Current Issue**: TypeScript build errors preventing deployment - code on `waterfall` branch
**🚀 Next Focus**: Fix build errors, test integrations, deploy waterfall branch
**📈 Strategic Position**: 162k+ certified buildings + climate data + 120x faster responses
**🇳🇴 Market Specialization**: Deep Norwegian energy ecosystem with transparent certified-only dataset

The project has comprehensive comparative intelligence ready but needs build fixes before production deployment. All code committed to `waterfall` development branch for safety.

*This master todo list should be updated at the end of each session and referenced at the start of new sessions for continuity.*
