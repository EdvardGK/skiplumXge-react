## Decision Log Integration

Key decisions affecting todo priorities:

2. **UX Approach**: Respect user intent, minimize friction for motivated visitors
3. **Grading System**: No custom A-G grades, only display existing Enova certificates
4. **User Journey**: Multi-step process requiring building data input after address

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete I/O strategy implementation**
2. **Analyze current landing page against actual service definition**
3. **Design improved user journey with proper incremental CTAs**
4. **Begin implementation of service-aligned copy and flow**
