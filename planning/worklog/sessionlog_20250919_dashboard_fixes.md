# Session Log - Dashboard Fixes
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Focus**: Dashboard component alignment and gauge sizing

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Dashboard Header Overlap
- **Problem**: Address info overlapping with dashboard cards after height optimization changes
- **Solution**: Moved address to top navigation bar, added proper padding to dashboard-header

### 2. Row 1 Cards Content Overflow
- **Problem**: All Row 1 cards had content cut off (e.g., "Krav: 120 kWh/m²/år" only half visible)
- **Root Cause**: Card heights were reduced but content sizing wasn't adjusted
- **Solution**: Removed redundant labels to create more vertical space (3 elements instead of 4)

### 3. Energy Gauge Component Issues
- **Problem**: Gauge was hardcoded to 240×120px, completely exceeding card boundaries
- **Solution**: Modified EnergyGaugeChart to respect size prop, created responsive sizing

## Critical Insight: Tailwind Classes vs Inline Styles

**Discovery**: Tailwind classes (`-mt-4`, `-mt-9`) were not affecting the gauge positioning, but inline styles worked immediately.

### Why This Happened:
- Tailwind classes can be overridden by component-specific styles
- The EnergyGaugeChart component may have internal positioning that conflicts
- Inline styles have higher specificity and override other styles

### Working Solution:
```jsx
// Doesn't work reliably:
<div className="flex items-end justify-center h-20 -mt-9">

// Works consistently:
<div className="flex items-center justify-center" style={{ marginTop: '-30px', height: '80px' }}>
```

## Final Dashboard Card Structure

### Optimized Row 1 Pattern:
1. **Icon + Badge** (20px height)
2. **Main Value/Component** (variable height)
3. **Subtitle** (16px height)

### Gauge Specifications:
- Size: 160×80px (semicircle)
- Positioning: `marginTop: '-30px'` to raise into proper position
- Letter scaling: Proportional to gauge size

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify visual changes** - Don't assume components are working just because not mentioned
2. **Grid calculations affect everything** - Changing dashboard height impacts all child components
3. **Component boundaries matter** - Understanding semicircle geometry (center line = bottom) is crucial
4. **Inline styles for critical positioning** - When Tailwind classes fail, inline styles ensure control
5. **Content must match container** - When changing container sizes, always adjust content proportionally

## Todo for Future Sessions
- Consider creating dashboard-specific component variants (mini-gauge, compact cards)
- Document the optimal card height formula for different screen sizes
- Create reusable patterns for dashboard tile content
