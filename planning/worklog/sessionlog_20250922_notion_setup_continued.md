# Session Log: Notion Control Center Setup (Continued)
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Session Focus**: Continuing Notion setup from previous session - database creation and population

## Session Overview
Continued from previous session that ran out of context. Worked through Notion API limitations to establish a working Norwegian energy engineering control center with 5 databases for live formula editing.

## What Was Completed

### ✅ 1. Environment Configuration Fixed
- Updated `.env.local` with new Notion token
- Added Supabase configuration for future integration
- Successfully connected to Notion API

### ✅ 2. Database Creation Process
**Initial Issues Encountered:**
- Notion API validation errors with properties
- Properties not being created despite successful database creation
- Norwegian property names causing issues
- API limitation: "Creating new status database properties is currently not supported"

**Solution Found:**
- Switched to English property names (e.g., "Name" instead of "Navn")
- Used underscores for multi-word properties (e.g., "Norwegian_Source")
- Successfully created 5 databases with basic property structure

### ✅ 3. Databases Created
Successfully created all 5 Norwegian databases:
1. **Beregningsformler**: `65b6323a-bbae-4658-9375-019fc9ca7a4b`
2. **Bygningstyper og energiforbruk**: `14f76636-6719-4ce9-b2d6-e1512a336dcc`
3. **Energisystem faktorer**: `81cd601c-d320-493d-bdbe-431efa5287e8`
4. **API endepunkter**: `0d99d45d-2006-4bcc-adc5-ad214cfb978f`
5. **Dashboard komponenter**: `93735648-45e8-455f-a335-637fa8176f49`

### ✅ 4. Documentation Created
Created comprehensive documentation in multiple formats:
- **Markdown**: `/planning/database/notion-database-structure.md`
- **LaTeX**: `/planning/database/notion-database-structure.tex`

Both documents include:
- Complete property specifications for all 5 databases
- Norwegian field names and descriptions
- Select field options
- Engineering workflow process
- Implementation instructions

### ✅ 5. Data Already Extracted
From previous session, we have `extracted-values.json` containing:
- 12 building types with energy consumption (kWh/m²)
- 7 heating systems with consumption factors
- Investment calculation constants (6% discount rate, 10-year period)
- 7 API endpoints currently in production
- 11 dashboard components mapped

## Key Learnings

### Notion API Limitations
1. **Cannot create complex property types** through API (Select with options, etc.)
2. **Properties must use English names** or simple characters
3. **Database creation succeeds** even when properties fail silently
4. **Manual database setup required** for complex structures

### Working Solution
- Create databases with basic properties via API
- Document full structure for manual creation
- Use population scripts once manual setup complete

## Files Modified/Created This Session

### Created
1. `/planning/database/notion-database-structure.md` - Complete database specifications
2. `/planning/database/notion-database-structure.tex` - LaTeX version for professional documentation
3. `/scripts/notion-database-ids.json` - Database IDs for API reference

### Modified
1. `.env.local` - Added Notion token and Supabase configuration
2. `/scripts/setup-notion.js` - Fixed to work with API limitations
3. `/scripts/populate-notion-data.js` - Updated with English property names

## Next Steps (For Future Session)

### Manual Setup Required
1. **Create databases manually in Notion** following the structure in `/planning/database/notion-database-structure.md`
2. **Add all Select field options** as specified
3. **Set up People fields** for engineer assignments
4. **Configure permissions** for engineering team

### After Manual Setup
1. **Run population script** with corrected property names:
   ```bash
   node scripts/populate-notion-data.js
   ```

2. **Implement live sync API** (`/api/config/notion-sync`):
   - Fetch approved values from Notion
   - Validate against Norwegian standards
   - Update production configuration
   - Log changes for audit trail

3. **Set up webhook integration** for real-time updates

4. **Test engineering workflow**:
   - Propose formula change
   - Review and approve
   - Monitor automatic deployment

## Technical Notes

### Notion API Insights
- Use simple property names without special characters
- Title property must be present in each database
- Properties object must be defined even if minimal
- Rate limiting: 200ms delay between operations recommended

### Data Population Ready
All Norwegian energy data extracted and ready:
- Building standards from NVE Report 2019-31
- SSB 2022 household consumption data
- SINTEF energy system breakdowns
- Current production formulas and constants

## Session Status
✅ **Partially Complete** - Databases created with basic structure, full manual setup required for complete property configuration. Documentation complete and ready for engineering team.

## Deferred to Next Session
- Manual database configuration in Notion
- Population of databases with Norwegian energy data
- Live sync API implementation
- Engineering workflow testing

**Note**: User indicated "We will get back to this another day" - system ready for continuation when manual Notion setup is complete.
