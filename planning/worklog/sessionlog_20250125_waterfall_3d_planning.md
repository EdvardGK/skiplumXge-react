## üåä Key Innovation: The Waterfall Concept

### Core Vision
Transform static energy dashboard into flowing narrative where data "waterfalls" through 6 connected acts:

1. **Property Discovery** - 3D building with aurora sky
2. **Heat Loss Analysis** - Thermal imaging with particle effects
3. **Seasonal Impact** - Circular calendar morphing to timeline
4. **Investment Opportunity** - Literal money waterfall visualization
5. **Neighborhood Comparison** - 3D constellation of buildings
6. **Action Plan** - Interactive roadmap with aurora milestones

### Visual Metaphor
- **Energy as Aurora**: Northern lights intensity reflects efficiency
- **Flow Physics**: Data moves like water through connected pools
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex insights revealed through exploration
- **Emotional Journey**: Color progression from cold inefficiency to warm optimization

## üèóÔ∏è 3D Neighborhood Innovation

### Technical Breakthrough
- **Real OSM Data**: Actual building footprints from OpenStreetMap
- **Accurate Norwegian Roofs**: Proper m√∏ne orientation, L/T shape handling
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click buildings for energy comparison
- **Aurora Sky**: Dynamic based on neighborhood energy waste
- **Performance Optimized**: LOD system for smooth 60fps experience

### Roof Geometry Accuracy
Critical insight: **Architectural accuracy separates professional tools from toys**

Key principles established:
- M√∏ne (ridge) always parallel to longest building dimension
- L-shapes have continuous roof with 90¬∞ direction change
- T-shapes have main body + perpendicular "ark" with valley
- Water drainage must follow realistic patterns

## üìä Implementation Strategy

### Dual Dashboard Approach
- **Keep existing grid dashboard** - No breaking changes
- **Add new waterfall route** - `/dashboard-waterfall`
- **Development toggle** - Switch between views during development
- **A/B testing ready** - Can compare performance metrics

### Technology Stack Requirements
```json
{
  "@react-three/fiber": "^8.15.0",
  "@react-three/drei": "^9.88.0",
  "@react-three/postprocessing": "^2.15.0",
  "three": "^0.159.0",
  "leva": "^0.9.35"
}
```

### Performance Targets
- **Desktop**: 60fps with full effects
- **Mobile**: 30fps with optimized visuals
- **Load Time**: < 3 seconds initial render
- **Engagement**: 80%+ scroll completion rate

## üé® Visual Design Philosophy

### Aurora Color System
- **Green**: Optimal efficiency, savings potential
- **Blue**: Cold baseline, neutral states
- **Purple**: Premium features, transformation
- **Pink**: Heat loss, attention needed
- **Gradients**: Smooth transitions between energy states

### Animation Principles
- **Scroll Physics**: Momentum with resistance at key insights
- **Morphing Data**: Pie charts flow into bar charts into waterfalls
- **Particle Systems**: Heat escaping, money falling, aurora ribbons
- **Progressive Loading**: Elements reveal as user explores

## üì± Responsive Strategy

### Device Adaptation
- **Desktop**: Full cinema mode with complex animations
- **Tablet**: Simplified effects maintaining story flow
- **Mobile**: Card-based with touch gestures, minimal particles

### Fallback Systems
- **No WebGL**: Static images with CSS animations
- **Low Performance**: Auto-detection and quality reduction
- **No JavaScript**: Server-rendered static version

## üèîÔ∏è Norwegian Cultural Integration

### Authentic Elements
- **Natural Phenomena**: Aurora, midnight sun, polar night
- **Building Standards**: TEK17 compliance, NS 3031:2014 calculations
- **Architectural Reality**: Proper roof shapes, drainage patterns
- **Language**: Norwegian UI with English development

### Avoiding Clich√©s
- No stereotypical Norwegian imagery (Vikings, flags, trolls)
- Focus on natural beauty and architectural accuracy
- Abstract representation of cultural elements
