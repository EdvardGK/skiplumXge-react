# Session Log: Enova Form Optimization - September 20, 2025

## Session Overview
**Objective**: Optimize building data form with Enova certificate pre-filling for better UX and data accuracy
**Status**: Planning phase complete, ready for implementation

## Key Insights Discovered

### Enova Dataset Analysis
- **`energy_consumption`**: Total energy delivered to building (kWh/year)
- **`energy_class`**: Official A-G energy grade
- **`heating_class`**: Heating system efficiency grade (separate from consumption)
- **`heated_area`**: Area used for energy calculations (m²)
- **Energy intensity**: `energy_consumption` ÷ `heated_area` = kWh/m²/year for TEK17 compliance

### Critical Understanding
- Enova energy consumption is based on **heated area only**, not total building area
- TEK17 requirements (115 kWh/m²/year) are calculated against heated floor area
- We have total energy consumption but need to ask for heated area with 90% assumption

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Category Mapping (Enova → Form)
```typescript
const enovaBuildingMapping = {
  'småhus': 'Småhus',
  'flerbolig': 'Flerbolig',
  'kontor': 'Kontor',
  'handel og service': 'Handel',
  'skole': 'Skole',
  'barnehage': 'Barnehage',
  'sykehus': 'Sykehus',
  'hotell': 'Hotell',
  'kultur': 'Kultur',
  'idrett': 'Idrett',
  'industri': 'Industri'
}
```

### 2. Form Pre-filling Strategy

**Fields we CAN pre-fill from Enova:**
- ✅ **Building Type** - Map `building_category` to dropdown options
- ✅ **Annual Energy Consumption** - Use `energy_consumption` directly (total delivered energy)
- ✅ **Construction Year** - Use `construction_year` if available
- ✅ **Total Area** - Use `total_energy_area` or estimate from `heated_area` × 1.1

**Fields we MUST still ask for:**
- ❌ **Heated Area** - Not reliably in Enova, keep current 90% assumption logic
- ❌ **Heating System** - Enova only has `heating_class`, not system type
- ❌ **Lighting System** - Not in Enova certificates
- ❌ **Ventilation System** - Not in Enova certificates
- ❌ **Hot Water System** - Not in Enova certificates

### 3. UX Flow Optimization
1. **User clicks "Start Analyse"** → Immediate Enova lookup using gnr/bnr
2. **Show loading state**: "Henter Enova-data..." during certificate fetch
3. **Pre-fill available fields** when certificate found, show indicator
4. **User completes remaining fields** (systems + confirms areas)
5. **Submit to dashboard** with both Enova data + user inputs

### 4. Dashboard Performance Enhancement
- Pass Enova certificate ID through URL parameters for dashboard re-use
- Dashboard can skip energy grade calculation if real certificate exists
- Use certified consumption vs calculated consumption for higher accuracy
- Show data source indicators (Enova vs calculated)

## Technical Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Enhanced Category Mapping
- [ ] Update building category mapping to handle more Enova variations
- [ ] Add fallback logic for unmapped categories
- [ ] Test mapping with real Enova data

### Phase 2: Form Pre-filling Logic
- [ ] Implement Enova data fetch on page load (when gnr/bnr available)
- [ ] Pre-fill form fields with certificate data
- [ ] Add visual indicators showing which fields came from Enova
- [ ] Maintain user ability to override pre-filled values

### Phase 3: Dashboard Integration
- [ ] Pass certificate ID through URL parameters
- [ ] Update dashboard to prioritize Enova data over calculated values
- [ ] Show data source transparency to users
- [ ] Implement fallback when certificate data unavailable

### Phase 4: UX Polish
- [ ] Add loading states for data fetching
- [ ] Improve error handling for failed lookups
- [ ] Test complete flow from address search to dashboard
- [ ] Validate TEK17 calculations with real Enova data

## Expected Benefits

### User Experience
- **Reduced manual input**: 4 of 9 form fields can be pre-filled
- **Higher accuracy**: Official certified data vs estimates
- **Faster completion**: Less typing, more confidence in data
- **Transparency**: Clear indication of data sources

### Data Quality
- **Certified energy consumption**: From official Enova certificates
- **Accurate building characteristics**: Construction year, type, areas
- **TEK17 compliance**: Proper heated area calculations
- **Audit trail**: Source of each data point documented

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Incomplete Enova Coverage
- **Mitigation**: Graceful fallback to manual input
- **Indicator**: Clear messaging when no certificate found

### Risk: Category Mapping Mismatches
- **Mitigation**: Conservative mapping, allow user override
- **Validation**: Test with real Enova dataset variations

### Risk: Area Calculation Discrepancies
- **Mitigation**: Show both total and heated areas for user verification
- **Default**: Maintain 90% heated area assumption as fallback

## Next Session Priorities
1. Implement enhanced category mapping
2. Add Enova data pre-filling to form
3. Test with properties that have certificates
4. Validate energy calculations match TEK17 methodology

**Files Modified**: TBD in implementation
**Key Decision**: Prioritize Enova certified data over calculated estimates
**Success Metric**: Reduced form completion time and increased data accuracy
