# Session Log - Grid Layout Fixes
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Topic**: Fixing card elongation on zoom and reorganizing dashboard grid layout

## Session Plan
1. Fix card elongation issue when browser zooms
2. Reorganize grid layout:
   - Row 1: All 4 columns with data point cards
   - Row 2-3: Columns 3-4 with map component, columns 1-2 with remaining data cards

## Changes Made

### 1. Card Component Fix
**File**: `src/components/ui/card.tsx`
**Issue**: Cards were elongating when zoomed due to `flex flex-col gap-6 py-6` classes
**Fix**: Removed `flex flex-col gap-6 py-6` from base Card component
**Result**: Individual cards no longer elongate

### 2. Grid Layout CSS Fixes
**File**: `src/app/globals.css`

#### Changes:
- Added `align-items: start` to prevent card stretching in grid cells
- Added height constraints: `height: fit-content; max-height: 200px` on grid cards
- Changed `gap: 1rem` to `gap: 16px` (fixed pixels instead of rem to prevent zoom scaling)
- Changed `margin-bottom: 1.5rem` to `margin-bottom: 24px`
- Updated map positioning: `grid-row: 2 / 4` (was `1 / 3`)
- Updated grid template: `grid-template-rows: 200px 200px 200px` (was `200px 200px auto`)

### 3. Card Content Spacing Fix
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Change**: Updated Enova card to use `space-y-3` instead of individual `mb-*` classes to prevent spacing issues

## Current Status
- ✅ Individual card elongation fixed
- ✅ Grid gap scaling fixed
- ✅ Cards reordered for optimal layout

### 4. Card Layout Reorganization
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

#### New Grid Layout:
- **Row 1 (All data cards)**: TEK17 Compliance, Energy Usage, Annual Waste Cost, Enova Certificate Status
- **Row 2**: Building Systems Overview, Building Age/Efficiency, Map Component (2x2)
- **Row 3**: Investment Room card (existing)

#### Added Cards:
1. **Building Systems Overview**: Shows heating system, lighting, and ventilation
2. **Building Age/Efficiency**: Shows building year and age calculation

#### Changes Made:
- Added two new data cards for complete row 1
- Moved map component to span rows 2-3, columns 3-4
- Fixed typo: "Ikke registreret" → "Ikke registrert"
- Applied consistent `space-y-3` spacing to all new cards

## Issues Encountered
- Initial attempts failed because we were targeting wrong elements
- Root cause was combination of scalable gaps (`rem` units) and grid stretching behavior

## Decisions Made
- Use fixed pixel units (`px`) instead of `rem` for grid layout to prevent zoom scaling
- Keep data cards in top row for priority visibility
- Map component gets prominent 2x2 position in right side of grid
