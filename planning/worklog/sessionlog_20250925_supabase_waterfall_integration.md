# Session Log: Supabase Data Integration in Waterfall Dashboard
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Objective
Integrate the Supabase data sources (Enova certificates, electricity zones, pricing) that were configured earlier into the waterfall dashboard, which was showing mock data.

## Problem Statement
The waterfall report wasn't using the real data from:
- Enova energy certificate database
- Municipality price zones (NO1-NO5)
- Electricity pricing data (36-month averages)
- Frost API weather data

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Connected Real Energy Data Hook ✅
**Added to dashboard-waterfall/page.tsx:**
```typescript
import { useRealEnergyData } from '@/hooks/use-real-energy-data';

const realEnergyDataFromHook = useRealEnergyData(
  addressParam,
  buildingData.priceZone as PriceZone | null,
  buildingData.gnr,
  buildingData.bnr,
  buildingData.municipalityNumber,
  buildingData.bygningsnummer,
  // ... certificate data
);
```

### 2. Investment Section Real Data ✅
**Before:** Hardcoded "92,400 kr" and "646,800 kr"
**After:** Dynamic calculation based on:
- Real electricity prices from Supabase
- Actual energy analysis calculations
- SINTEF 70/15/15 percentage breakdown
- Zone-specific pricing (not hardcoded 2.80 kr/kWh)

### 3. Seasonal Section Updates ✅
**Added:**
- Real electricity pricing display
- Price zone information
- NS 3031 climate data references
- Seasonal consumption calculations based on building area

### 4. Property Hero Section Enhancements ✅
**New features:**
- Enova certificate status display
- "Enova-sertifisert" vs "Ikke registrert" labels
- Price zone card showing:
  - Zone name (e.g., "Østlandet")
  - 36-month average price
  - Data source: "NVE • Supabase database"

### 5. TypeScript Props Updates ✅
Updated all section components to accept:
- `realEnergyData?: RealEnergyData`
- `energyAnalysis?: any`

## Data Flow Established

## Build Results

```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 10.2s
✓ Checking validity of types
✓ Generating static pages (22/22)

Dashboard sizes:
- Regular dashboard: 350 KB
- Waterfall dashboard: 503 KB (includes React Three Fiber)
```

## Technical Architecture

### React Three Fiber Usage
- **PropertyHeroSection**: 3D building model with OrbitControls
- **ComparisonSection**: BuildingConstellation component
- **BuildingMesh**: Custom 3D component with V-shaped roofs
- Building colors: Cyan (Kontor), Emerald (Bolig), Purple (Sykehus)

## Data Sources Now Active

1. **Enova Energy Certificates**
   - Table: `energy_certificates`
   - Shows: Energy grade, consumption, certification status

2. **Electricity Pricing**
   - Table: `electricity_prices_nve`
   - Shows: 36-month average, current prices by zone

3. **Municipality Zones**
   - Table: `municipality_price_zones`
   - Maps: Kommune number → Price zone (NO1-NO5)

4. **Investment Calculations**
   - Formula: Annual waste × 7 = Investment room
   - SINTEF breakdown: 70% heating, 15% lighting, 15% other

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Mock data with "Input X%" placeholders
- Hardcoded 280 øre/kWh pricing
- No real Enova data
- Generic "OK/OVER" status

### After
- Real calculations with source labels
- Zone-specific pricing from Supabase
- Actual Enova certificate lookups
- Percentage-based TEK17 compliance
- "Kilde: NVE/SINTEF/Enova" labels

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Deploy to Vercel for production testing
- Monitor performance with 3D graphics
- Test with real user addresses

### Future Enhancements
- Add Frost API real-time weather data
- Implement zone comparison insights
- Add more detailed heat loss calculations
- Create PDF export from waterfall view

## Commands Used
```bash
yarn build  # Successful build with 0 errors
```

## Session Success Metrics

✅ All Supabase data sources integrated
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Build size acceptable (503 KB)
✅ Real data replaces all mock placeholders
✅ Source labels throughout ("Kilde:" or "Krever:")

**Session Result:** Successfully transformed the waterfall dashboard from mock data to full Supabase integration, maintaining the engaging 3D visualizations while providing real, actionable energy insights from Norwegian data sources.
