```

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (clean, data-focused)
- **Display Font**: Space Grotesk (for headlines and 3D text)
- **Mono Font**: JetBrains Mono (for data values)

### 3D Design Principles
- **Depth Hierarchy**: Use z-axis to represent data importance
- **Particle Systems**: Northern lights effects as data transitions
- **Organic Motion**: Fluid, natural movements mimicking energy flow
- **Material Design**: Glass morphism with subtle emissions

## 3. Dashboard Layout & Scroll Journey

### Section 1: Hero Building Visualization
```
Component: 3D Building Model with Energy Aura
- Building outline pulsates with energy consumption level
- Northern lights particles flow from high-consumption areas
- Real-time energy "heartbeat" visualization
- Interactive hotspots showing problem areas
```

### Section 2: Energy Consumption Breakdown
```
Component: Circular Flow Diagram (3D Pie + Particle Streams)
- Sectors represent: Heating, Cooling, Lighting, Equipment, Other
- Particle streams show energy waste as escaping particles
- Hover reveals exact percentages and cost implications
- Comparison to ideal benchmarks
```

### Section 3: Comparative Analysis
```
Component: 3D Bar Chart Forest
- Your building as central tower
- Surrounding "trees" represent peer buildings
- Height = energy efficiency
- Color intensity = improvement potential
- Interactive filtering by building type/age/size
```

### Section 4: Cost Impact Visualization
```
Component: Money Flow Waterfall
- 3D currency symbols flowing through efficiency gaps
- Stacked bars showing current vs. potential costs
- Animated savings calculation with particle explosions
```

### Section 5: Carbon Footprint
```
Component: Environmental Impact Sphere
- Earth-like sphere with CO2 cloud density
- Interactive timeline showing historical and projected impact
- Comparison to natural equivalents (cars, trees, etc.)
```

### Section 6: Recommendation Engine
```
Component: Interactive Upgrade Path
- 3D flowchart of recommended improvements
- Cost/benefit bubbles with ROI timelines
- Priority scoring via size and glow intensity
- Click-to-expand implementation details
```

## 4. Technical Architecture

### React Three Fiber Component Structure
```javascript
// Main dashboard structure
<EnergyDashboard>
  <ScrollManager>
    <CameraController>
      <Scene environment={northernLightsEnv}>
        <BuildingModel />
        <DataVisualizations />
        <ParticleSystems />
        <UIOverlay />
      </Scene>
    </CameraController>
  </ScrollManager>
</EnergyDashboard>
```

### Key Three.js Techniques
- **Custom Shaders**: Aurora borealis effects using GLSL
- **Instanced Meshes**: For efficient particle systems
- **Raycasting**: Interactive data point selection
- **Post-processing**: Bloom, color grading, depth of field

### Performance Optimization
- LOD (Level of Detail) systems for complex models
- Geometry and texture recycling
- Progressive loading during scroll
- WebGL fallbacks for older devices

## 5. Data Integration & Calculations

### Real-time Data Flow
```
User Input + GIS Data → Calculation Engine → 3D Visualization
     ↓
Benchmark Database → Comparative Analysis → Interactive Insights
```

### Key Metrics to Visualize
- Energy Use Intensity (EUI)
- Carbon Emissions (kgCO2/m²)
- Cost per Square Meter
- Efficiency Score (0-100)
- Improvement Potential (%)
- Payback Period (years)

## 6. Interactivity Design

### Scroll-based Animations
