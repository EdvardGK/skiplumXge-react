# Development Plan for January 22, 2025

## Morning Session (9:00-12:00): Responsive Design & Text Scaling

### 1. Implement Responsive Text Sizing (1 hour)
- Add responsive text utilities to all dashboard cards
  - Large values: `text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl`
  - Labels: `text-xs sm:text-sm`
  - Subtitles: `text-xs md:text-sm`
- Update icon sizing for responsive scaling
  - Small icons: `w-4 md:w-5 lg:w-6`
  - Large icons: `w-8 md:w-10 lg:w-12`
- Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

### 2. Container Query Implementation (1 hour)
- Add CSS container queries for card content scaling
- Create utility classes for container-responsive text
- Ensure charts scale properly within their containers
- Test energy breakdown chart legend readability at different sizes

### 3. Mobile UX Improvements (1 hour)
- Fix button sizes for better touch targets on mobile
- Adjust padding and spacing for mobile cards
- Ensure efficient building messages display properly on small screens
- Test the "Ingen øyeblikkelige investeringsbehov" text wrapping

## Midday Session (12:00-14:00): Code Cleanup & Git Setup

### 4. Version Control & GitHub Push (30 mins)
- Initialize git repository properly if needed
- Create comprehensive commit of all recent changes
- Set up GitHub repository
- Push code with proper .gitignore configuration

### 5. Documentation Update (30 mins)
- Update todos_master.md with completed tasks
- Create sessionlog_20250122_responsive_design.md
- Document efficient building handling logic
- Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns

### 6. Code Organization (1 hour)
- Move any testing/temporary files to versions folder
- Clean up unused imports
- Review and optimize bundle size
- Run build and fix any warnings

## Afternoon Session (14:00-17:00): Feature Enhancement

### 7. Complete "Kommer snart" Features Planning (1 hour)
- Design Energianalyse feature specifications
- Plan Sløsing article content structure
- Create mockups for future implementations
- Document in planning/future-features.md

### 8. Advanced Efficient Building Features (1 hour)
- Add optimization suggestions for efficient buildings
- Create smart home integration recommendations
- Design sustainability scoring system
- Implement comfort improvement suggestions

### 9. Performance Optimization (1 hour)
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimize image loading with Next.js Image
- Add loading skeletons for data fetching
- Test Core Web Vitals scores

## Testing & Quality Assurance (17:00-18:00)

### 10. Comprehensive Testing
- Test all efficient building edge cases
- Verify responsive design on real devices
- Test with various Norwegian addresses
- Validate data flow from search to dashboard
- Check accessibility with screen readers

## Priority Order:
1. **Critical**: Responsive design (users need mobile experience)
2. **High**: Git/GitHub setup (code safety)
3. **Medium**: Code cleanup and documentation
4. **Low**: Future feature planning

## Success Metrics:
- [ ] Mobile Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] All text readable on 320px screens
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub successfully
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Efficient buildings show proper messaging
- [ ] All breakpoints tested (mobile/tablet/desktop)

## Files to Create/Update:
- `/planning/session-plans/sessionlog_20250122_responsive_design.md`
- `/planning/future-features/kommer-snart-specs.md`
- Update `/planning/worklog/todos_master.md`
- Create responsive utility classes in globals.css
- Update all dashboard card components

## Dependencies:
- Ensure build passes before GitHub push
- Test on actual mobile devices if available
- Verify Vercel deployment still works after changes

## Context from Today's Session (Jan 21)

### Completed Today:
- ✅ Implemented efficient building handling
- ✅ Added conditional messaging for buildings better than TEK17
- ✅ Created "God effektivitet" display for zero waste buildings
- ✅ Updated ROI card to show "Ingen øyeblikkelige investeringsbehov"
- ✅ Changed pie chart legend to show % for efficient, NOK for inefficient
- ✅ Fixed "Sløsing" card with proper button design
- ✅ Cleaned up redundant messaging for efficient buildings

### Key Logic Implemented:
```javascript
// Efficient building detection
hasRealBuildingData && realEnergyData.annualWaste === 0

// Conditional displays:
// - ROI: "Ingen øyeblikkelige investeringsbehov" (smaller text)
// - Første steg: "Optimalisering" instead of "Varmepumpe"
// - Sløsing: "God effektivitet" instead of waste amounts
// - Pie legend: Percentages instead of NOK amounts
```

### Current State:
- Dashboard properly handles both efficient and inefficient buildings
- Clean, minimal UI for efficient buildings
- Actionable recommendations for buildings needing improvements
- Professional card layouts with consistent styling

This plan builds on today's successful efficient building handling and addresses the identified responsive design gaps while ensuring code is properly versioned and documented.
